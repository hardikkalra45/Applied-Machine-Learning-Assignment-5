Assignment 5: 

Transfer Learning for image data using CNN


- Download about 100 images of ducks and 100 images of chickens from the internet
- In a google colab notebook, fine-tune a pre-trained convolutional neural network to classify duck vs chicken and output the classification report


Transfer Learning for text data using Transformer


- Download the sentiment analysis dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhir92shrivastava/sentiment-analysis-dataset
- Build a sentiment analysis classifier to classify the sentiment into positive, neutral, and negative by fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model and print your classification report
